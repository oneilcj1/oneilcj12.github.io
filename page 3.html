<li> I work as a mechanic at my towns local garage. Ive worked at Manchester Gas & Service for over 4 years now, and have learned many tricks of the trade in my time there. 
<li> Before I worked on cars, I was an employee at my towns bike shop.  I worked there from the age of twelve to fourteen.  In just two short years however, I learned just about all there is to know about bicycles.  I attended a school that taught me how to properly fit someone to their own bike, so that they can have a productive and unpainful riding experience.
