<li> My family has lived in my hometown for multiple generations.(Fathers side). I live in Manchester by-the-sea with my mother Vicki, and sister Jennifer. Due to health issues, my father, Charlie, passed away in August 2016. From this tragic event my mother, sister, and I have grown very close and depend deeply on one another.

<li> Due to the lack of family photos, I decided to include my families favorite winter vacation destination.  Pictured above is the town of North Conway, New Hampshire.  North Conway is home to two ski mountains located very close by, as well as a great storefront area downtown for visitors to shop through.
