<li>I was born in Portland, ME and was raised in Brunswick, ME. I graduated Brunswick High School and am now a freshmen at the University of Maine at Orono. My favorite sports include surfing and skateboarding. Attached below is a picture of me when I went to Austria with my mom, sister and best friend. We enjoyed a nice beer and an evening on the town sitting next to a very drunk bachelor party and a guy wearing a green strap thong. The video attached below is a video of my favorite surfing clips, which I like to watch and relax to. I really enjoy learning about Business and Wildlife. I love to travel and explore places that I have never been. I have travelled around Europe and North America. The most important people in my life is my father and my brother, who I look up to most.

<li>This is a website that I believe has great information for the rising increase in the Marijuana market and legalization of the drug across the United States. It informs people about many different characteristics to the potency and different strains of Marijuana, while community members can review and upload different pictures and comments; to provide an outsider and consumer perspective. I think it is a fantastic website that has very much potential.
